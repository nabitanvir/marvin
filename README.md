A facial recognition and voice recognition model trained and deployed on a Raspberry Pi 5 with an integrated camera. Many current smarthome systems require purchasing various products in order to build a fully functional smart home ecosystem. This means (on top of being expensive) many devices may not function without a supplementary device that solves the dependencies of these ecosystems as well as combats concerns with privacy.
