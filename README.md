A facial recognition and voice recognition model trained and deployed on a Raspberry Pi 5 with an integrated camera. Many current smarthome systems require purchasing various products in order to build a fully functional smart home ecosystem. This means (on top of being expensive) many devices may not function without a supplementary device that solves the dependencies of these ecosystems as well as combats concerns with privacy. 

## Hardware used:
- Raspberry Pi 5 with 8GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage
- Ubuntu 24.10 OS

## To Do:
- [ ] Develop lightweight audio processing model using quantization and train to recognize me specifically.
- [ ] Develop lightweight facial recognition model using a MobileNet and train to recognize me specifically.
- [ ] Chain models together to correctly recognize me and allow control of my smart appliances.
- [ ] Integrate control of my smart home lighting using Philips Hue REST API.
- [ ] Train to recognize wake word "berry"

### Secondary Tasks:
- [ ] Build an aesthetically pleasing case for the Raspberry Pi 5

Documentation on how to develop this on your own will be included in the repository.
